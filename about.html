<h1>Mission Statement</h1>
</div>
<div>
<p class="mission">Built for English speakers that want to study new languages, either casually or with purpose,
  the Top Free Language Learning Resources website is a directory of online applications that allows
  any user to partake in language studies regardless of income or socioeconomic class. Unlike many
  other sites containing resources for language learning, our site will not include costly programs
  that only certain users can afford. No resources will require payment for use.</p>
<p class ="mission">This site groups resources into 3 main types:<b> immersive, linear lessions</b>, and <b>self study</b>.
Immersive resources allow users to interact with other users of the target language via text and speaking in real time.
Linear lessions provide users with language courses that progress in a linear function; they teach skills hierarchically.
Self study resources provide the tools through which learners can teach themselves an assortment of new vocabulary.  </p>
